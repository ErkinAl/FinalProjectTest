# YOLOv8 Pose Detection Optimization
## Key Optimizations

1. Reduced model size from 320x320 to 256x256 for faster inference
2. Implemented direct YUV to tensor conversion without bitmap intermediates
3. Used pre-allocated buffers to avoid garbage collection
4. Added temporal smoothing for jump detection with a 5-frame history
5. Optimized rendering with hardware acceleration and path-based drawing
6. Added visual feedback for jump detection

These changes provide significantly faster and more responsive pose detection and jump counting.
